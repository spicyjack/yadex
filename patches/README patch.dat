*** Patches readme
This assumes that you have previously compiled and installed yadex.
If you have not, you should do that first to test that independently.
Read the README for compile and install.

** Apply the patches contained
  patch -l -N -d <src-dir>  <src-patches>
* with backup
  patch -b -l -V -d <src_dir>
* example
  patch -l -N -d /usr/local/src/yadex-1.7.0/src  patch_dir/*.diff
  
* If you get a "HUNK #n failed" message then you will have to
investigate the .rej file that is created.
  cd ../src
  ls *.rej
  less *.rej

Some patches contain changes that may have already been made in your
copy.

* If you get .rej files, then open it with an editor and copy it into
the target file by hand.  There should be enough context to see the
difference and what the patch is trying to accomplish.

You likely have another patch applied that is confusing patch.

The first three lines of the patch give the command used, the source
file, and the dest file.

If it has:
  --- yadex-1.7.0/src/orig/things.cc   1999....
  +++ yadex-1.7.0/src/things.cc        2009....
It is a normal diff.
Notice that the file name with the +++ and the new date is the dest,
so you need to edit yadex-1.7.0/src/things.cc.
Each patch within the diff is marked by a line giving the line number
range.

If it has:
  *** ../orig/things.cc		Thu Jul  9 17:17:59 2009
  --- ../src/things.cc		Sat Aug 29 02:48:16 2009
It is a context diff.
Notice that the file name with the --- and the new date is the dest,
so you need to edit yadex-1.7.0/src/things.cc.
Each patch within the diff has before and after sections, with
surrounding context, and is marked by syntax that gives the line number
range.

  	<source lines>
  --- 304,326 ----
	<dest lines>	


Each line of the patch has a leading character that indicates what the
patch is doing to that line.  This lead character must be removed when
you copy a patch line to the dest file.
Interpretation:
  <space>	context line, do not change
  +		add this line
  - 		delete this line
  !		line changed
  		- Original is in the source line listing (*** line).
		- Desired result is in the dest listing, after the --- line.

In many cases the dest lines can simply be copied and pasted into the
target file, with the first char deleted from each.


** Select options

Edit the file yadex.h
Select an option by uncommenting the define.

#define USE_STDINT
 // Use the stdint definitions that customize the 16 and 32 defines
    to the machine.  This is safest for new 64 bit machines where the old
    assumptions fail.

#define SMALL_LAPTOP_KEYBOARD
  // Use alternative key assignments for the INSERT and DELETE keys.
  // Some laptops do not have these keys.

  

** Compile and install

Change to the yadex directory
  cd /usr/local/src/yadex-1.7.0
Compile
  make
If you get errors then look for .rej files and fix the patch.

Install
  make install
